        <h2>Blog Post Title</h2>
        <p>One of the major issues we have in the United States is an abundance of information and subjective opinions but no common method to prove what is true and what isnâ€™t. This has lead us to be divided on what is simply fact or fiction. I would argue that mathematics and data is the foundation of reasoning. We can bring families back together and reunite America by creating better tools for confirming information before we have disagreements on half truths. We have seen an outstanding evolution in AI in recent years, clearly outpacing us in terms of logic and rationality. Mathematics is an incomprehensibly large field that intersects into every other field we currently are away with. It is the rule and order behind the universe and life itself. I believe math is simply a medium to pursue truth in a language that is timeless and global. No matter what area of the Earth you are on, the rules of math follow which allows us to communicate at higher level. Scientists all over the planet can share and interpret data that has been carefully collected through studies. This allows us to preserve accurate information and continuously analyze, inching closer to truth with every revision. The origin of math may be uncertain but it is the proof of a higher order, that there is a rhyme and rhythm to every aspect of life.</p>
